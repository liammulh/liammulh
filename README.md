Hello! My name is Liam Mulhall. I'm a software engineer based in the San
Francisco Bay Area. I occasionally blog about things I'm learning or
working on at [liammulh.net](https://liammulh.net). I have an
[about page](https://liammulh.net/about.html) on my blog.

## What I'm working on right now

In my free time, I'm working my way through Robert Nystrom's *Crafting
Interpreters* book and learning Java and C in the process.

## Experience and education

I work at Stanford University School of Medicine on the [Clinical Genome
Resource](https://clinicalgenome.org/) where I traverse the stack in
Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.

I obtained a BA in mathematics with a focus on computation from the
Univerisity of Colorado Boulder. I have a minor in computer science. In
my computer science courses, I mostly programmed in C++.
