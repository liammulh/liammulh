Hello! My name is Liam Mulhall. I'm a software engineer based in the San
Francisco Bay Area.

I work at Stanford University School of Medicine on the [Clinical Genome
Resource](https://clinicalgenome.org/).

I have experience across the stack in Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.

I studied mathematics with a focus on computation at the Univerisity of
Colorado Boulder. I have a minor in computer science. In my computer
science courses, I mostly used C++.

In my free time, I'm working my way through Robert Nystrom's *Crafting
Interpreters* book and learning Java in the process.
