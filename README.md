Howdy! My name is Liam Mulhall. I work at Stanford University School of
Medicine on the [Clinical Genome Resource](https://clinicalgenome.org/)
(ClinGen) project. ClinGen is an initiative funded by the National
Institutes of Health dedicated to constructing a central repository
elucidating the clinical significance of genes and variants for
precision medicine and research. In my role at ClinGen, I craft and
maintain front-end and back-end features for ClinGen's gene curation
interface and its variant curation interface.
